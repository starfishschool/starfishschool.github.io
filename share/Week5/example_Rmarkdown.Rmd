```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

### Here's a subheading

Below is how you make a bullet point list. These are types of ice cream that I like:

* chocolate
* strawberry
* Moosetracks
* coconut

## Math

Math is fun. Here's a display equation: $$ M(r<R) = 4\pi\int \rho (r) r^2 dr $$ And here's some inline math $\pi=3.14...$ Yay LaTeX! 

## Some other useful stylish things

Here's how you do _italics_ and this is how you write in **bold** 


## Let's show a bit more R code and another plot

There is some R code here that won't show up because I've set echo=FALSE.
```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(truncnorm)
truncnorm.prior <- function(pars, ppars){
  
  # pars must be given in the correct order as shown below
  dtruncnorm(x = pars, a = ppars[1], b = ppars[2], mean = ppars[3], sd = ppars[4])
  
}


```

But this next part will show up because it doesn't have echo=FALSE
```{r, fig.width=5, fig.height=3}
#### prior on M
rvals = seq(0,10, length.out = 1e3)

rhpars = c(0, 30, 3.4, 0.6)

plot( rvals, y = truncnorm.prior(pars = rvals, ppars = rhpars), type="l", main=expression(Prior~on~r[h]), lwd=2,  xlab=expression(r[h]), ylab="density")
grid()


```
