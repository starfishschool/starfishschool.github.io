############ Week 2 Exercises

### Mini exercise 1

## Write a function takes in a real number L_0 in meters for e.g., length, and computes the length L if the object is travelling at v in units of light speed





### Mini-exercise 2

## Generate 100 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution

# choose and define values for the two parameters of a normal distribution: the mean (mu) and the variance (sigma)



# Plot an estimate of the distribution of these x values using a histogram. (hint: look up the hist() function by typing ?hist in the console)



# let's put the true distribution on the plot too! :) We can do this with the function curve(). We will pass curve the dnorm() function, which is the probability density funtion for the normal distribution





## Generate 100000 random numbers from a Gaussian distribution and show that they are much better approximated by a Gaussian distribution (i.e. plot a Gaussian curve)


# Plot an estimate of the distribution of these new x values using a histogram. (You can look up the hist function by typing ?hist in the console)



# Put the true distribution on top of the histogram
